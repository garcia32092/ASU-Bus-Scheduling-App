# Deliverable Information
   > Please include your answers below in a good format so it is easy for me to see. For answers to questions please use these Blockquotes. Make sure you also check the kickoff document for more details. Also make sure this thing is well formatted and the links are links in here. 

## 1: Basic Information (needed before you start with your Sprint -- Sprint Planning)

**Topic you chose:** Bus Scheduling

**Sprint Number:** NO. 3

**Scrum Master**: Andres Morales De Jesus

**Git Master**: Frank Lin

### Sprint Planning (For Sprint 1-3)
Document your Sprint Planning here. Also check the kickoff document for more details on what needs to be done. This is just the documentation. 

**Sprint Goal:** Our Sprint goal is to complete the program

**How many User Stories did you add to the Product Backlog:**  9

**How many User Stories did you add to this Sprint:** 
> 10

**Why did you add these US, why do you think you can get them done in the next Sprint?**

> These user stories are for finalization of the program's design, testing creation, and cleaning up of legacy code.

**Why do you think these fit well with your Sprint goal? (details)**

> As stated above, these are finalizations necessary for the program to be complete.

**Do you have a rough idea what you need to do? (if the answer is no then please let me know on Slack)**

> Yes



## 2: During the Sprint
> Fill out the Meeting minutes during your Sprint and keep track of things. Update your Quality policies when needed, as explained in the lectures and in the Quality Policy documents on Canvas. 
I would also advise you to already fill out the Contributions section (End of sprint) as you go, to create less work at the end.

### Meeting minutes of your Daily Scrums (3 per week, should not take longer than 10 minutes):
> Add as many rows as needed and fill out the table. (Burndown starts with Sprint 2 and Travis CI starts with Sprint 3, not needed before that). 

| Date  | Who did not attend  |Meeting notes (very brief)   | Burndown Info (on track, ahead behind is enough) | TravisCI info (does the master pass) | Additional Info  |
|-------|---|---|---|--|--|
|23-06-26|   | Sprint 3 Planning  |   |  |  |
|23-07-02| | Sprint Checkin |   |  |  |

### Meeting Summary:

> Add rows as needed and add the number how many meetings for each team member:

   Eli : 2

   Josh : 2
   
   Will : 2

   Andres : 2

   Frankie : 1
   
## 3: After the Sprint

### Sprint Review
Answer as a team!

> Answer the following questions as a team. 

**What do you think is the value you created this Sprint?**

>  We finished the project: full value

**Do you think you worked enough and that you did what was expected of you?**

> The team as a whole yes, some individuals put in more value that others

**Would you say you met the customers’ expectations? Why, why not?**

> yes, project finished


### Sprint Retrospective

> Assignment 5 threw a wrench in progress towards all members. If Assignment 5 was not as time consuming, more time could have been spent on memoranda

**Did you meet your sprint goal?**

> Yes, project completed

**Did you complete all stories on your Spring Backlog?**

> Yes, other than SpotBugs

**If not, what went wrong?**

> Assignment 5 took a ton of time

**Did you work at a consistent rate of speed, or velocity? (Meaning did you work during the whole Sprint or did you start working when the deadline approached.)**

> No. The first week of the Sprint was consumed by assignment 5

**Did you deliver business value?**

> yes, project completed

**Are there things the team thinks it can do better in the next Sprint?**

> N/a, no next sprint

**How do you feel at this point? Get a pulse on the optimism of the team.**

> Extremely optimistic
